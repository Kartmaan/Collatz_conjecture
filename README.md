# Syracuse_qt
Program generating series of numbers from the Collatz conjecture. The program allows to:
- Visualize graphically a single input value
- Compare two input values in the form of two superimposed graphs
- Display more detailed statistics (flight time, max altitude, number of even / odd values, etc.)
- Save graphics in .png format
- Copy the lists of numbers generated to the clipboard
- Randomly generate numbers
